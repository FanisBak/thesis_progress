\title{\textbf{Time series forecasting improvement using GPT and LLM models.\\
}}

\section{Progress week 4}

Firstly, I changed the subject of my thesis due to the difficulty in finding an appropriate dataset for anomaly detection.\\
\\
So, the new subject of my thesis will be time series forecasting using Time-GPT and Time-LLM models. A prediction will be made on a dataset with both LLM or GPT models and with Neural networks. Then, all models will be compared using their Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\\
\\
I have already made two of these models on a dataset about the visitors of a Public store.
The neural network model has a MAE of 14. \\
The model using Time-GPT has a MAE of 8. \\
\\
For the Time-GPT model I used the Long-horizon forecasting tutorial from NIXTLA found in this link: 
\href{https://www.nixtla.io/docs/tutorials-training-tutorials-long_horizon_forecasting#evaluation-results}{Time-GPT} \\
\\
More references are going to be added soon.
