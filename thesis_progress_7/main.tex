\section*{Progress week 7}

For this week progress, I continued writting the text of my thesis. More than half the text is completed. I also created a few new plots to help visualize the models comparison, while also the Time-GPT model with no finetuning of exogenous variables, in order to see the results of finetunig a model and also to have a better comparison with the other two models since they are not finetuned or at least not to that level. Moreover, I completed the Intership Report. 

The next step is to complete my thesis text and do a last check for corrections.
