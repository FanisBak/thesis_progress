\section{Progress week 3}

I am still working on writing the theoretical parts of my thesis.

About the data, managed to find some more and I will probably have them available to use inside this week. Now the data (columns) that I will probably be able to have are: the number of visitors that enter and exit the store, average occupancy, and the average time spent by people on that site (average dwelling time). Maybe I could also get the position of people passing by (posX, posY, posZ), their speed (doppler), the elevation and signal-to-noise ratio (snr). If you think they are not good enough, please inform me and I could use your help.

As you see, these new data are from cameras and not EAS sensors, so I might change the thesis a bit.
